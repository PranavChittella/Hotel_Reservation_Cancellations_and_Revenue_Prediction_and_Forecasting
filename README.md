# Hotel_Reservation_Cancellations_and_Revenue_Prediction_and_Forecasting
##Predicting the bookings that might get cancelled and also forecasting the ADR , which shows the revenue that the company can generate using Time Series Forecasting and Deep Learning

Insight about the Data:
This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking.

Problem Statement:
The data points us to various segments of Machine Learning with many variables, hence I have chosen it perform classification for predicting the cancellations of the bookings made.Also, as an extension we are predicting the ADR as a time-series variable.
ADR (Average Daily Rate) is defined Calculated by dividing the sum of all lodging transactions by the total number of staying nights.
